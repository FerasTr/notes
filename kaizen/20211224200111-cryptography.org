* Hashing
Hashing functions are one way functions which theoretically provide a unique output for every input.

** Hashing Algorithms
When creating a hashing algorithm, it is important to check for collision resistance. If a collision is found, two different inputs can have the same hash which results in a security threat.

- SHA-1
- SHA-2
- MD5
- CRC32

* Resources
 - ctf101
