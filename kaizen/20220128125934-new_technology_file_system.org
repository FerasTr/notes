#+title: New Technology File System

* Overview
New Technology File System (NTFS) is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file.

* Advantages of NTFS
NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems, such as:
- Supports files larger than 4GB.
- Set specific permissions on folders and files.
- Folder and file compression.
- Encryption ([[id:8c0a451b-90b6-40f9-a6b1-a7f24992e7a5][EFS]]).
