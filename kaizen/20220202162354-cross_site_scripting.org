* Overview
Cross Site Scripting (XSS), is a vulnerability where a user of an application can send [[id:91bb374f-27a4-49a0-bb6b-5fb77987abc6][JavaScript]] that is executed by the browser of another user of the same application.

Since JavaScript has the ability to modify the page (DOM), send HTTP requests and access cookies, XSS can maliciously use JavaScript to extract user's cookies (if not protected via correct flags) and send them to an attacker controlled server.

* Types of XSS
XSS is typically  broken down into three categories:
- [[id:d4335212-4121-4151-bd33-fa0ff006104c][Reflected XSS]]
- [[id:d021d8bf-bd38-4e54-b469-e2c9a8c4e7c8][Stored XSS]]
- [[id:7084f6a8-bb11-42c3-b570-c77fc6fa2560][DOM XSS]]
