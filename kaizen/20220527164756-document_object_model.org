#+title: Document Object Model

* Overview
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an abstract representation of an [[id:c11dfdff-dac6-40ba-b8a0-f37e30abe8fc][HTML]] document that can be queried and manipulated through its [[id:e7b32d9c-0f2e-4405-bdd4-8d97b784c772][API]].

The DOM allows client-side scripts to access individual HTML elements by their ~id~ and to traverse the structure of elements programmatically. The DOM also includes an event model, allowing code to hook into events such as form submission and keystrokes.
