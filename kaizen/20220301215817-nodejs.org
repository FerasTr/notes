* Overview
* Middleware
Middleware refers to any code on the server that runs between getting a request and getting a response. Middleware runs from top to bottom until we exit the process.

A simple middleware can be used for loggin:
#+begin_src js
app.use((req, res) => {
  console.log('host: ', req.hostname);
});
#+end_src

** next()
The problem with the above code is that Express doesn't know how to move on after it executed the middleware code. To indicate that we are done, we add the ~next()~ function, which tells Express to move on to the next middleware.
#+begin_src js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('host: ', req.hostname);
  next();
});
#+end_src
