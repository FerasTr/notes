* Overview
When a website receives high traffic, it sometimes becomes unresponsive, this is unacceptable when we demand high availability. A solution to this problem is to add more servers, but this introduced another problem, how can we decide which server is to receive the next load of traffic?

Load balancers will receive requests, then forward it to one of the multiple servers. Different algorithms are used to determine which server to use, such as /round-robin/ and /weighted/.
