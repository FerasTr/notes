* Overview
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Position Independent Executable (PIE) is the randomization of the place in memory where the program, shared libraries, the stack, and the heap are. This makes it harder to exploit a service, as knowledge about where the stack, heap or libc can't be re-used between program launches. This is partially effective way of preventing an attacker from jumping to libc without a leak in its address location.

This feature can be disabled using the following command:
#+begin_src sh
sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
#+end_src
