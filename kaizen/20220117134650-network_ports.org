* Overview
* How To Keep Ports Secure
1. Enable a firewall or endpoint protection to protect these ports from attackers. Use a blacklist to prevent connections from known attacker's IP addresses or use a whitelist to only allow specified IP addresses.
2. Use a [[id:d37868e3-3220-4acc-b4a4-d3f6996238c3][VPN]] to encrypt and protect network traffic.
3. Implement VLANs to isolate internal network traffic.
4. Use MAC address filtering to keep unkown systems from accessing the network.
