* Mastering a skill

Effective practice is the key, the amount of time you put in is not the only factor, the practice must be of high quality.

1. Remove distractions and focus on the task at hand.
2. Start slowly; coordination is built from repetition. Increase speed and quality over time.
3. Frequent repetitions with breaks; increase the number of sessions with breaks in between.
4. Practice in your brain in vivid details.
