#+title: Directory Traversal
#+filetags: :webexp:

* Overview
Directory Traversal is a vulnerability where an application takes in user input and uses it in a directory path. If the input isn't properly sanitized or properly sandboxed, then the application could be vulnerable to such an attack.

* Example
#+begin_src php
<?php
    $page = $_GET['page']; // index.php
    include("/var/www/html/" . $page);
?>
#+end_src
If the application is designed such as the user can pass input to the GET parameter and then its loaded, then we can exploit it as follows:
#+begin_example
../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
#+end_example
