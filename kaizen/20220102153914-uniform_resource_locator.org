* What is a URL?
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet. A URL can has different features.
#+begin_example
http://user:password@example.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3
#+end_example
We discuss each feature using the above example:
- Scheme (~http://~) - This instrucs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP.
- User (~user:password~) - Some services require authentication to log in.
- Host (~example.com~) - The domain name or IP address of the server.
- Port (~80~) - The port that we want to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
- Path (~view-room~) - The file name or location of the resource we are trying to access.
- Query String (~?id=1~) - Extra information about the requested path.
- Fragment (~#task3~) - A reference to a location on the requested page (path).
