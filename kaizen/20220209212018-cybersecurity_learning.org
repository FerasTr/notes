#+title: Cybersecurity Learning
#+filetags: :learning:Cybersecurity:Studying:Interview-Prep:

* Overview
In here, we dive into cybersecurity specific [[id:f9546923-3a8e-4e43-94f7-5ec6a338b40e][interview preparation]] methods including:
- A roadmap that covers all resources available to me as of writing.
- Definition of terms that are related to cybersecurity.
- A brief introduction to popular certificates.
- A brief introduction to popular software and technologies.
- Job descriptions and difference between them.
- Popular questions used in interviews.
- Resources.

* Learning
Some people worry about spoilers and robbing themselves of a potential learning experience (reading writeups for example), ignoring these resources can slow down your success.

When learning to hack vulnerable machines, there are three skills that are necessary to master:
1. Technical Foundation
   Understanding how services work internally as well as concepts like networking. Having a strong foundation allows people to quickly perform enumeration which aids in turning a simple proof of concept into a weaponized exploit or efficiently pivoting throughout a network once an initial foothold is gained.
2. Hacking Techniques
   Identifying services and knowing the attack paths of this service. This is the easiest to learn as it isn't hard to know what tools or payloads to try out on a service. Having a strong foundation will help catching the small things.
3. Persistence and Endurance
   Knowing how to keep driving into a problem looking for creative ways to get information out of it. This is a combination of creative thinking and stick-to-it that takes a long time to develop

After gaining root on a box, it is /critical/, or even more important, to read writeups of other hackers. This will help you catch anything you miss and give you another perspective that you didn't know otherwise.

The best way to improve is to grind-it-out. [[id:4273fcdf-58e9-409b-b196-19860eb9478c][Repetition]] is the name of the game, the more boxes/targets/vulnerabilities you expose yourself to, the more you learn about the inner-workings and techniques required to tackle such tasks.

* Roadmap
My current roadmap as of <2022-02-26 Sat>.

The following is an ordered list of some resources that I need to go through. They are ordered in order of difficulity and urgency (what topic I need to learn). The roadmap will be continually updated and changed. My current goal is to finish the first half by mid 2022 to help with future research position jobs.

Somethings will be omitted from the list such as: TryHackMe, HackTheBox, HackerOne, Bugcrowd and CTF competitions as I believe that those resources are to be visited and studied daily/weekly in no particular order/schedule. The idea is, if im done for the day with the current learning resource, then I should be spending the rest of my time on one of the above.
